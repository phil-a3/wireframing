*What Is Wireframing* ?
Wireframing is the process of creating a simplified visual representation (or blueprint) of a digital product's layout, such as a website or mobile app. It outlines the basic structure and elements on each screen or page without focusing on visual design or content.

Wireframes typically include:

Placeholder boxes for images

Text blocks

Buttons

Navigation menus

Forms or interactive elements

They are usually created in black and white or grayscale to keep the focus on layout and functionality rather than color and style.

*Why Wireframing Is Important in the Design Process*
1. *Clarifies Layout and Structure*
Wireframes help teams visualize the page layout early in the project, making it easier to plan user flow and content hierarchy.

2. *Improves Communication*
They serve as a visual communication tool between designers, developers, clients, and stakeholdersâ€”ensuring everyone is aligned before moving to high-fidelity designs.

3. *Saves Time and Resources*
Catching layout issues or usability problems early in wireframes is much easier (and cheaper) than fixing them later in development.

4. *Enhances User Experience*
Wireframing allows teams to test and improve navigation and interaction flows early, leading to better usability and user satisfaction.

5. *Supports Agile Design*
In iterative design processes, wireframes provide a flexible foundation for quick revisions, user feedback, and incremental improvements.
